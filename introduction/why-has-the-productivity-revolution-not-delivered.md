# Why has the productivity revolution not delivered?

When it comes to so called Knowledge Work, the glorified term for white collar work, the technology leaps we hail as awesome haven't given us what they promised. Mainly because we are blinded by the metaphors for work, and as such apply the patterns of 'the factory' and the the idea of 'managing' the work as if these meta layers are part of the actual production of value. This is a fundamental misunderstanding of how work is done in the knowledge economy. To apply Lean and other operation models that aim to make work more efficient, is a fools errand since they are based on the assumption that work is a linear, volume based process, which can be improved if only the flow is optimized and each knowledge operator can produce more artefacts per work day, or we need fewer operators per artefact.

## The Artefact Volume Fallacy

As the term _Knowledge_ Work implies, you can know more or less about something. In other words, the quality of the knowledge is the key factor. We can call this 'skill level' when we talk about the individual or the organization, and we can call it just 'quality' when it comes to the artefact itself.

Sometimes it feels like the digitalization of work as a concept has acted as a veil for earlier findings like those portrayed in 'Service Management' (_Normann, 1984_) and 'Knowledge Work' (_Drücker, 1996_) that should be seen as, and are, a base layer regardless of what tools we use to accomplish the work.&#x20;

But these researchers, as well as many others like Rafael Ramirez at Oxford, have shown just how bad a metaphor the factory is when it comes to organize and to develop work as an activity in the knowledge economy.&#x20;

### The Layers of Administration Cul de Sac

At the same time, we can still hear anecdotal factoids used as the basis for making decisions on how to organize work. 'A manager can only oversee X people'. 'A department should never be larger than 120 people, because that was the size of our villages before'. These and other so called golden rules of management reveal their intellectual fragility not only when compared to real history, psychology and tried and true, alternative solutions. But also when you see where the earliest companies during the Industrial Revolution took their template from when it came to the administration of the production.&#x20;

Because of the propensity of military jargon in business speak, it's not surprising that many jump to the conclusion that companies just lifted the org chart from the chain of command. After all, we even talk about a command and control culture. But if we look closer at the timing and the actual work done by early white collar workers, we can see that the whole structure of middle management was lifted from the colonial administration of the territories, the export/import and production from them. Which brings a slighlty new and truer shade to the term _white_ collar.

But again, the organisation of moving physical goods extracted from the provinces is more similar to the procurement to, and flow of parts through a factory in order to produce a product. Than the production of knowledge, of information.&#x20;

And when we realize that digital products actually are a collection of, sum of, knowledge we can use the differentiation between goods and service/knowledge that Normann, Drücker et al made clear as a thought tool to get us out of anecdotal mires.

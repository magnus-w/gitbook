# Why has the productivity revolution not delivered?

When it comes to so called Knowledge Work, the glorified term for white collar work, the technology leaps we hail as awesome haven't given us what they promised. Mainly because we are blinded by the metaphors for work, and as such apply the patterns of 'the factory' and the the idea of 'managing' the work as if these meta layers are part of the actual production of value. This is a fundamental misunderstanding of how work is done in the knowledge economy. To apply Lean and other operation models that aim to make work more efficient, is a fools errand since they are based on the assumption that work is a linear, volume based process, which can be improved if only the flow is optimized and each knowledge operator can produce more artefacts per work day, or we need fewer operators per artefact. 

## The Artefact Volume Fallacy

As the term *Knowledge* Work implies, you can know more or less about something. In other words, the quality of the knowledge is the key factor. We can call this 'skill level' when we talk about the individual or the organization, and we can call it just 'quality' when it comes to the artefact itself.
